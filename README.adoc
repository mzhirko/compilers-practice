=== 4. Minimization algorithm.

1.Let the set P(0,1,2,3,4,5) be the set of all states. Decompose it into two subsets according to the condition with states (0,1,2,3,4) and (5), where the subset (0,1,2,3,4) contains non-conclusive states, and the subset (5) contains the final state. +
2. The first subset is split into 2 more with states (0,1,3) and (2,4), because for all input symbols the transition by input symbol goes to the final state from the same group. +
3. We split the first subset into 2 with states (0,1) and (3). +
4. We divide the first subset into 2 with states (0) and (1). As a result, we obtained that only one of states 2 and 4 can be kept, e.g. 2. The number of states of the finite automaton is reduced by one. +

Let us prove that it is minimized: +
{q0,q1,q2,q3}  {q4} +
{q0,q1,q2}  {q3}  {q4} +
{q0}  {q1}  {q2}  {q3}  {q4}

=== 5. We obtained a determined and minimized finite automaton.
