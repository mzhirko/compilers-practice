=== 4. Minimization algorithm.

1.Let the set P(0,1,2,3,4,5) be the set of all states. Decompose it into two subsets according to the condition with states (0,1,2,3,4) and (5), where the subset (0,1,2,3,4) contains non-conclusive states, and the subset (5) contains the final state. +
2. The first subset is split into 2 more with states (0,1,3) and (2,4), because for all input symbols the transition by input symbol goes to the final state from the same group. +
3. We split the first subset into 2 with states (0,1) and (3). +
4. We divide the first subset into 2 with states (0) and (1). As a result, we obtained that only one of states 2 and 4 can be kept, e.g. 2. The number of states of the finite automaton is reduced by one. +

Let us prove that it is minimized: +
{q0,q1,q2,q3}  {q4} +
{q0,q1,q2}  {q3}  {q4} +
{q0}  {q1}  {q2}  {q3}  {q4}

=== 5. We obtained a determined and minimized finite automaton.

[#task2]
== Task №2
=== 1. Language description.
<P> ::= <H> (<B>)... +
<H> ::= 'h' ('t' 'i')... +
<B> ::= 'b' (',' 'b')... ';'

=== 2. Constructing grammar following language description.
P -> H +
P -> HG +
G -> BG +
G -> ε +
H -> hN +
N -> tiN +
N -> ε +
B -> bM; +
M -> ,bM +
M -> ε

=== 3. The grammar is context-free (CF) because the characters on the left side are non-terminals and the characters on the right side are terminals or non-terminals.

=== 4. Construct parse trees for the three examples.
.htiti
image::./task2-1.png[]
.htib,b;
image::./task2-2.png[]
.htib,b;b,b,b;
image::./task2-3.png[]

=== 5. The grammar is not left-recursive because there is no rule of the form A -> Aα.
=== 6. The grammar is non-factorized because species rules occur.
A -> aC +
A -> aD +
Left-factorizing the grammar: +
replacing P -> H and P -> HG with P -> HC where C -> G ,  C -> Ɛ. +
The transformed grammar will look as follows:
P -> HC +
C -> G +
C -> ε +
G -> BG +
G -> ε +
H -> hN +
N -> tiN +
N -> ε +
B -> bM; +
M -> ,bM  +
M -> ε +
Since C -> G , C -> Ɛ , and G -> BG , G -> ε , we can ignore C and write it this way: +
P -> HG +
G -> BG +
G -> ε +
H -> hN +
N -> tiN +
N -> ε +
B -> bM; +
M -> ,bM +
M -> ε

=== 7. Using the transformed grammar, construct parsing trees.

== Task №3
=== 1. Language description.
<P> ::= <H> (<B>)... +
<H> ::= 'h' ('t' 'i')... +
<B> ::= 'b' (',' 'b')... ';'

=== 2. Constructing grammar following language description.
P -> H +
P -> HG +
G -> BG +
G -> ε +
H -> hN +
N -> tiN +
N -> ε +
B -> bM; +
M -> ,bM +
M -> ε

=== 3. The grammar is nonleft-recursive and left-factorized.

=== 4. Let us define the meaning of the FIRST and FOLLOW functions for the developed grammar.
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*FIRST*             |            *FOLLOW*
|P = {h}             |            P = {$}
|H = {h}             |            H = {b, $}
|N = {t,  ε}         |            N = {b, $}
|M = {, , ε}         |            M = { ; }
|B = {b}             |            B = {b, $}
|G = {b, ε}          |            G = {$}
|===

=== 5. Let's build a predictive analyzer table. 
[width="50%",options="header"]
|====================================================
|        |h     |ti     |b      |,      |;      |$  
|P       |P->HG |       |       |       |       |
|H       |H->hN |       |       |       |       |
|N       |      |N->tiN |N->ε   |       |       |N->ε
|G       |      |       |G->BG  |       |       |G->ε
|B       |      |       |B->bM; |       |       |
|M       |      |       |       |M->,bM |M->ε   |
|====================================================

=== 6. Let's check the correctness of the construction with examples.
==== Correct examples: 

*htib;$* +
P$ +
HG$ +
hNG$ +
NG$ +
tiNG$ +
NG$ +
G$ +
BG$ +
bM;G$ +
M;G$ +
;G$ +
G$ +
$ 

*htitib,b;$* +
P$ +
HG$ +
hNG$ +
NG$ +
tiNG$ +
NG$ +
tiNG$ +
NG$ +
G$ +
BG$ +
bM;G$ +
M;G$ +
,bM;G$ +
M;G$ +
;G$ +
G$ +
$ 

Wrong example:

*hbtib,b;$* +
P$ +
HG$ +
hNG$ +
NG$ +
tiNG$ - mistake, because there is an extra terminal b in the string.

[#task4]
== Task №4

=== Initial grammar for the function declaration:

S -> Aa +
A -> Ac | Bb |  ε +
B -> cB |  ε +

=== 1. Get rid of the left recursion and left-factorize the grammar:

    First we have to get rid of ε-transitions for products with left recursion:

S -> Aa | a +
A -> Ac | Bb | c +
B -> cB | ε +

    Then we have to get rid of the left recursion directly:

S -> Aa | a +
A -> BbA’ | cA’ | Bb | c +
A’ -> cA’ | c +
B -> cB | ε +

    The last step is to left-factorize the grammar:

S -> Aa | a +
A -> BbС | cС +
A’ -> cD +
D - > c| ε +
С -> A’ | ε +
B -> cB | ε

=== 2. Construct the FIRST and FOLLOW functions for the grammar given in the condition:
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*FIRST*             |            *FOLLOW*
|(S) = {a,с,b}       |           (S)={$}
|(A) = {с,b}         |           (A)={а}
|(B)={с, ε}          |           (B)={b,c,$}
|(C)={c, ε}          |           (C)={$}
|(А’)={с}            |           (А’)={$}
|(D)={c, ε}          |           (D)={$}
|===


=== 3. Building a set of clauses. To do this, number the rules and add a fictitious zero rule. After that the grammar will look like this: 

1. S’->S +
2. S->Аа +
3. S->а +
4. A->BbC +
5. A->cC +
6. A’->cD +
7. D->c +
8. D-> ε +
9. C->A’ +
10. C-> ε +
11. B-> ε +
12. B->cB +

    The set of clauses for a given grammar is represented as: 

I0 = {S’ ->・S, S->・a, S -> ・Aa, A->・cC, A->・BbC, B-> ・, B->・cB} +
I1 = goto(I0, S) = {S’->S・} +
I2 = goto(I0, a) = {S->a・} +
I3 = goto(I0, A) = {S->A・a} +
I4 = goto(I3, a) = {S->Aa・} +
I5 = goto(I0, c) = {A->c・C, C-> ・, C-> ・A’, A’ -> ・cD} +
I6 = goto(I5, C) = {A->cC・} +
I7 = goto(I5, A’) = {C-> A’・} +
I8 = goto(I5, c) = {A’->c・D, D->・c, D->・} +
I9 = goto(I8, D) = {A’->cD・} +
l10 = goto(l8,c) = {D->c・} +
I11 = goto(I0, B) = {A->B・bc} +
I12 = goto(I0, c) = {B->c・B, B->・cB, B->・} +
l13 = goto(l12,B) = {B->cB・}

[#task5]
== Task №5

=== Task: F2,C3 -> C1

=== Given code:

*F3*
[source,c++]
----
int f(int n) { return n * 3 + 1;} 
int main(void) { 
  int d = f (4); 
  return f(5) + d; 
}
----

*C1*

Syntax tree;

*C3*

Three-address code. 4s

=== 1. Construction of intermediate code:

1.1. As a syntax tree:
.syntax tree for the source code
image::./tree.png[]

=== 2. Typology of intermediate code commands.

For the syntax tree and for the dag:

- program - program. Contains the list of program statements.

- op+ - the list of program statements. Contains the operator and a link to the next.

- next_op - reference to the next operator of the list. Contains the operator and reference to the next one (reference can be absent).

- assignment - assignment operator. Contains the object to which the value is assigned and the value that is assigned.

- For_op is an iteration loop operator. It consists of an assignment operator, a conditional operator, and a list of loop body operators.

- < - logical operation "less than". It consists of two objects that are compared by this operator.

- strlen is an operator for finding the length of a string. Contains the string the length of which is found.

- scanf is the input operator. Contains the list of parameters.

- param+ - the list of function's parameters. Contains the parameter and the link to the next parameter.

- next_param - reference to the next function's parameter. Contains the function's parameter and the link to the next parameter (the link may be absent).

- & - address taking operator. Contains the object, the address of which is taken.

- * - operator of multiplication. Contains numbers to be multiplied.

- printf - output operator. Contains the list of parameters.

- [] - array element reference by index. Contains array, which is called and the index of the requested element.

=== 3. Optimization of the intermediate code.

To make it clearer, we will perform optimization over the source code, and then show how it is reflected in each type of intermediate code.

Let us perform distribution of copies:

[source,c++]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
 scanf(“%d”, f);
 int d = i * f * 3;
 printf(“%d”, d);
}
----

&#129047;

[source,c++]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
 scanf(“%d”, f);
 int d = i * f * 3;
 printf(“%d”, i * f * 3);
}
----

Let's remove the useless code:

[source,c++]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
 scanf(“%d”, f);
 int d = i * f * 3;
 printf(“%d”, i * f * 3);
 }
----

&#129047;

[source,c++]
----
for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
 scanf(“%d”, f);
 printf(“%d”, i * f * 3);
 }
----

=== 4. Let's write the resulting optimized intermediate code as quadruples.
